# F# Playground

## Overview

Functional programming is fun and .NET has a feature-packed standard library... Let's see how easy it'd be to start using F# at work!

Also a good place for trying out generative testing using (FsCheck)[https://github.com/fscheck/FsCheck].

## Setup

:notebook: [Ionide for VSCode](https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp) is highly recommended for a lightweight F# IDE

- **App**: `cd FSharpPlayground && dotnet run`
- **Tests**: `cd FSharpPlaygroundTests && dotnet test`
